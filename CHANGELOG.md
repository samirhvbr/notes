# Changelog

Entries in the commit-message format (`version - short description in English`, see
[docs/versioning.md](docs/versioning.md)), newest first. **Each `##` heading is
literally the commit subject** — this file is the handoff artefact between
whoever does the work and whoever commits it.

Bodies are narrative: what changed, why, and what was measured. This file is
never rewritten.

## 0.1.1 - rename the project to notes

The project was called `franknote` until this commit. The name is dropped
because the `frank-` slot is already taken by a known project in the same space
(`frankmd`), and a name that collides costs more attention than it earns before
a single line of product exists.

`notes` is provisional and deliberately plain: it holds the slot until the
product has a shape worth naming, and renaming again is cheap for as long as
there is nothing but documentation here.

The rename went through GitHub's own rename, so the old URL redirects and any
link already pointing at `franknote` keeps working. The hook escape variable
followed the name — `FRANKNOTE_NO_HOOK` is now `NOTES_NO_HOOK`, declared at the
top of both hooks and in `docs/versioning.md`.

**The `0.1.0` entry below keeps its original wording.** At that commit the
project was `franknote`, and this file is not rewritten — a changelog that
retro-names its own history stops being a record of what happened.

## 0.1.0 - initial documentation structure

<!-- Replace this entry. The heading IS the commit subject, so write it in
     English, in the format `X.Y.Z - description`. The body is prose: what
     changed, why, and what you measured — not a bullet list. -->

First commit of franknote, a desktop app for writing Markdown, standalone and optionally linked to a public Git repository.

The documentation skeleton comes from the fleet standard at
[samirhvbr/repodocs](https://github.com/samirhvbr/repodocs) — the norm itself
lives there and is **not** copied into this repository, so there is one place to
change it.
