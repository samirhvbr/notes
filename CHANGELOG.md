# Changelog

Entries in the commit-message format (`version - short description in English`, see
[docs/versioning.md](docs/versioning.md)), newest first. **Each `##` heading is
literally the commit subject** — this file is the handoff artefact between
whoever does the work and whoever commits it.

Bodies are narrative: what changed, why, and what was measured. This file is
never rewritten.

## 0.2.0 - record the product scope and roadmap in docs/

The scope arrived as a 1 338-line draft in `.continue/`, written in Portuguese.
Two rules in this repository say it cannot stay there: a queue item that needs
half a page belongs in `docs/` with a pointer left behind, and everything in the
repository is written in English (US). This commit lands the first half of that
conversion — [docs/product.md](docs/product.md) and
[docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md).

`product.md` is the definition: local-first, a user-chosen folder as the
workspace, `.md` files on the filesystem as the source of truth, one dark theme,
CodeMirror 6, Source/Preview/Split with Live Preview explicitly deferred, and the
list of what the first version does not do. The promise it exists to protect is
that the files belong to the user rather than to the application — everything
else in the document is downstream of it.

`roadmap.md` is the order: seven product milestones from a desktop editor to an
MCP server. Its ordering constraint is that **each stage is useful on its own** —
someone who stops receiving updates after the first one still has a working
Markdown editor. It also states in its own header that its stage numbers are
product milestones and not repository versions, because `0.3` there and `0.3.0`
in `version.md` are otherwise going to be read as the same thing.

This is a `Y` bump rather than a `Z`: the repository went from having no product
definition to having one, and every later decision is measured against it.

## 0.2.0 - record the architecture in docs/

[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md), the second half of the scope
conversion. It opens with the layering rule — Markdown is the source of truth,
SQLite is index and cache, the server is sync, REST is integrations, MCP is
agents — because that is the rule every later proposal gets checked against, and
the two forbidden shapes (SQLite as the only copy of a note; a proprietary
format with a Markdown export bolted on afterwards) are written down as
forbidden rather than left to be inferred.

Two things in the draft contradicted each other and are resolved here. The
`apps/` + `crates/` + `server/` layout and the `src/` + `src-tauri/` layout are
not two proposals: the second is what lives *inside* `apps/notes-app/`. The page
states both levels together, and adds the rule that makes the split worth
anything — **the Rust logic lives in `crates/`, and `src-tauri/` stays a thin
shell with no business logic**, which is what lets `server/` reuse the core at
milestone 0.5 instead of extracting it under pressure.

The filesystem abstraction is documented as existing from milestone 0.1, when it
will have exactly one adapter behind it. That looks like premature generality, so
the page carries the reason inline: "a folder the user picked" is a desktop
concept that iOS does not have, and finding that out after the UI has been
written against local paths is a UI rewrite.

The sync section states the constraint that shapes the data model years before
sync is built — `modified_at` alone cannot synchronise anything, because clocks
disagree, filesystems round timestamps differently, and a restored backup
rewrites them all.

## 0.2.0 - record the founding decisions as ADRs

Eight ADRs in [docs/decisions.md](docs/decisions.md), replacing the skeleton's
template. They exist so that the expensive parts of the scope are not
re-litigated by the next session — each one carries the reason and, more
importantly, the cost.

ADR-001 is the load-bearing one: Markdown files on the filesystem are the source
of truth, with no proprietary format at any point. It is recorded with what it
gives up — sync gets harder, indexing must be incremental, writes must be atomic
because the file is the only copy — because a decision that lists only benefits
has not been thought through.

The rest: Tauri 2 over Electron and Flutter, with the platform-webview tax
stated; Rust logic in `crates/` with a thin `src-tauri/`, so `server/` can reuse
the core at 0.5 without an extraction under pressure; `.notes/` restricted to
data that can be rebuilt, with the "delete it — did the user lose anything they
wrote?" test that keeps it from silently becoming the proprietary store ADR-001
forbids; sync deferred but its identity model protected, because an app built on
path + `modified_at` cannot be given sync later, only rewritten; Git dropped as
a dependency; no network port opened by default, since an editor that quietly
listens on a laptop joining untrusted networks is not a default worth shipping;
and desktop before mobile, with the filesystem seam carried from 0.1 so that 0.4
is an adapter rather than a rewrite.

ADR-006 is the one that records a reversal: the project was first sketched as a
Markdown editor with a public Git repository attached, and local-first replaced
it. Written down as a decision rather than dropped, so the idea does not come
back as a suggestion.

Also fixes a section reference in `roadmap.md` that pointed at
`architecture.md#3` when the filesystem abstraction is §4 — stale in the same
pass that created it.

## 0.3.0 - an item leaves the queue only when it has been built

`0.2.1` put the deleted drafts back. This writes down the rule that would have
stopped them being deleted, because an override nobody wrote down is not an
override — it is a mistake waiting to be repeated by whoever reads the rules and
obeys them.

**[ADR-009](docs/decisions.md#adr-009--an-item-leaves-continue-only-when-it-has-been-built):
an item leaves `.continue/` when the thing it describes has been BUILT** — not
when it has been documented, decided, translated or written up. A queue note
reading "a black screen with a yellow ball in the middle" stays in the queue
until that screen exists and works. **Size is never a reason to move an item
out**, which is the second half of the override: the fleet rule sending a
half-page queue item to `docs/` is exactly the rule that was followed into the
`0.2.0` mistake, and a 1 300-line specification stays in the queue while its code
does not exist. And nothing leaves the queue before it has been committed — the
operational half, which would have made `0.2.0` cost a `git revert` instead of a
reconstruction from memory.

The ambiguity that caused it is one word, and the ADR names it: the fleet
convention says a document moves to the record when it describes "something that
already exists", and *exists* was read as the definition existing rather than the
thing existing. Under the first reading, describing something well is what makes
it real. The failure is worst on a new project and that is not incidental — on
day one everything is words and nothing is code, so a rule that retires an item
once its text is tidy retires the whole queue. Which it did: four open items to
zero, with no application code written.

Golden rules 1 and 2 in `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`, the "how it works" list in
`.continue/README.md` and the "where a new document goes" table in
`docs/README.md` all said the old thing and now say this one, each pointing at
ADR-009. Three files repeating a rule is worse than one when they disagree, and
they disagreed with the owner's intent in the same direction, which is how the
mistake looked correct at every checkpoint.

This is a `Y` because an ADR that overrides a fleet convention now counts as one.
That trigger did not exist before this commit and is added by it — a repository
quietly diverging from the fleet is exactly the change that has to be visible in
the version history, and `Z` would have buried it.

## 0.3.0 - write the queue in Portuguese and translate on the way out

[ADR-010](docs/decisions.md#adr-010--continue-is-written-in-portuguese-everything-else-is-english):
`.continue/` is written in Portuguese, and translation to English happens at the
moment the material leaves the queue — which, per ADR-009, is the moment the
thing has been built. Everything else is unchanged and stays English (US):
`docs/`, commit messages, pull requests, issues, code comments, changelog
entries, release notes.

The queue is where the owner thinks before anything exists, and a second language
is a tax on precisely the part of the work least able to carry one. It was also
part of the `0.2.0` argument for emptying the queue — "it is in Portuguese" read
as a defect to fix rather than as the queue working correctly.

**The exception is written outside the `LANGUAGE-RULE` markers, and that placement
is the point of the commit.** That block is a marked echo regenerated from
repodocs; an exception written between the markers is erased by the next fleet
pass with nobody noticing, leaving a repository whose stated rule contradicts its
practice. The precedent is `BLUE3-INTRANET`, whose language exception sits
outside the block for the same reason. The new section says so in its own first
line, so that a later reader tidying the file does not move it inside.

`.continue/README.md` stays in English and now says why: it is the folder's
index, not queue material.

## 0.3.1 - take SCOPE_final.md into the queue as the version to build

`.continue/SCOPE_final.md` — the owner's v2.0 specification, in Portuguese, as
[ADR-010](docs/decisions.md#adr-010--continue-is-written-in-portuguese-everything-else-is-english)
provides. It supersedes the two v1 drafts beside it and is the document the
application gets built from. Committed on arrival, because the rule that nothing
leaves the queue uncommitted is worth as little as its counterpart on the way in
— the v1 drafts were lost at `0.2.0` precisely for want of this commit.

It closes decisions the v1 left open, and several of them contradict ADRs that
are currently `ACTIVE`: identity lives in the app's own registry and **no `id`
is ever written into a `.md`**, not even when sync is switched on; the content
hash stops being identity and becomes a correlation signal with explicit
ambiguity rules; data outside the notes splits into three categories where only
the derived one is disposable, which moves `index.db` out of the workspace by
default — an active SQLite database copied mid-transaction by Dropbox or iCloud
is a corrupt database; a concurrency guard ships with autosave at 0.1a rather
than with sync; and a timeboxed 0.0 spike now precedes 0.1a.

Those reversals are not applied in this commit. An ADR is reversed by an ADR,
and this one only records the arrival of the document that argues for it.

## 0.3.0 - mark the unbuilt specifications as PROPOSED

`product.md`, `architecture.md` and `roadmap.md` were written at `0.2.0` and
marked `ACTIVE`, which claimed they described something that exists. They
describe an application with no code. They are now `PROPOSED`, each carrying the
same header: nothing here has been built, the specification still lives in
`.continue/`, **the queue is the authority on intent while both exist**, and a
section becomes `ACTIVE` when its code exists and works.

That resolves the duplication ADR-009 creates rather than pretending it is not
there. The same subject is in the queue in Portuguese and in `docs/` in English,
and the pair only stays honest if the direction of authority is written on the
face of the document — otherwise the next reader picks whichever they opened
first. `.continue/README.md` states the same rule from its side: an `ACTIVE`
document in `docs/` wins a contradiction, a `PROPOSED` one does not.

`decisions.md` stays `ACTIVE`, deliberately. A decision exists the moment it is
taken — the ADRs are the artefact, not a description of a future one — and it is
the record that stops a settled direction being re-litigated during exactly the
long stretch of a project where nothing has been built and everything is still
arguable.

Golden rule 4 already said an undeclared status is read as `ACTIVE` and that
this is "exactly the failure mode". Three documents were sitting in it.

## 0.2.1 - restore the scope drafts to the queue

`0.2.0` deleted `.continue/scope.md` and
`.continue/scope.md — Aplicativo Markdown Local-First.md` on the reading that
writing them up in `docs/` had finished them. That reading is wrong for this
repository: an item leaves the queue when it has been **built**, not when it has
been documented. Nothing in those two files exists as code, so they belong in the
queue, and they are back in it.

They had never been committed, so they were not recoverable from the history —
they are reconstructed here from the session that deleted them, and are content-
complete rather than byte-identical to the originals.

The queue's "where things went" table is corrected too: it claimed the drafts had
migrated to `docs/`, which was the same mistake stated as fact.

The rule this violated is not yet written down anywhere — that is the next
commit, and it is why this one only repairs.

## 0.2.0 - adopt the scope in the agent instructions and empty the queue

The last block of the conversion: making the documents the repository actually
reads agree with the four that were just written.

`CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` had `_to be filled in._` in all three identity slots.
They now carry the stack, the repository layout and — the part worth having — a
list of things not to do without an ADR reversing the one named: no note stored
anywhere but as a `.md` file, no metadata written into a user's note that the
user did not ask for, no file identified by path plus `modified_at`, no
listening port in the desktop app, no touching `.git/` in a workspace. An
instruction file that only describes the project is a file an agent skims; one
that names the five ways to break it is one that changes behaviour.

The `X`/`Y`/`Z` bump triggers stopped being the skeleton's examples and became
this project's, in both the twins and `docs/versioning.md`. A `Y` here is a
completed roadmap milestone, a new crate, a change to the `FileSystemAdapter`
surface, an index-schema change forcing a reindex, or an ADR reversing an
earlier one. Both places also state that milestone numbers are not versions:
`0.3` in the roadmap and `0.3.0` in `version.md` will otherwise be read as the
same thing, and they are not kept in step.

`README.md` describes what the project is rather than what it was going to be,
and says plainly that there is no application code here yet — the pre-flight in
`docs/runbook.md` §6 asks for exactly that, and this repository is public.

`.continue/` is empty of drafts. The two scope files are recorded in its "where
things went" table with links to what replaced them. **They were never committed,
so they are not in the history** — their content lives in `docs/`, translated and
split, and nowhere else. The three questions that were open in the queue are
closed and named against the ADRs that answered them, so they are reversed by a
new ADR rather than re-opened as a queue item.

## 0.1.1 - rename the project to notes

The project was called `franknote` until this commit. The name is dropped
because the `frank-` slot is already taken by a known project in the same space
(`frankmd`), and a name that collides costs more attention than it earns before
a single line of product exists.

`notes` is provisional and deliberately plain: it holds the slot until the
product has a shape worth naming, and renaming again is cheap for as long as
there is nothing but documentation here.

The rename went through GitHub's own rename, so the old URL redirects and any
link already pointing at `franknote` keeps working. The hook escape variable
followed the name — `FRANKNOTE_NO_HOOK` is now `NOTES_NO_HOOK`, declared at the
top of both hooks and in `docs/versioning.md`.

**The `0.1.0` entry below keeps its original wording.** At that commit the
project was `franknote`, and this file is not rewritten — a changelog that
retro-names its own history stops being a record of what happened.

## 0.1.0 - initial documentation structure

<!-- Replace this entry. The heading IS the commit subject, so write it in
     English, in the format `X.Y.Z - description`. The body is prose: what
     changed, why, and what you measured — not a bullet list. -->

First commit of franknote, a desktop app for writing Markdown, standalone and optionally linked to a public Git repository.

The documentation skeleton comes from the fleet standard at
[samirhvbr/repodocs](https://github.com/samirhvbr/repodocs) — the norm itself
lives there and is **not** copied into this repository, so there is one place to
change it.
